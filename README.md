This project is regarding Sentiment Analyis and it predicts the sentiments in movie reviews. I have used the IMDB movie review dataset and created the model using Logistic Regression. 
The web app us created using Streamlit.
The steps involved here are:
-Importing modules
-Creating the dataframe
-Cleaning the datasets and removing stopwords from it
-Creating the model and training it
-Using sklearn metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Here I have achieved an accuracy of about 97%
-Exporting the model to create the web app using streamlit
